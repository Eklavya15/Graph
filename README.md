# 🧠 LeetCode Graph Problems – Solutions

This repository contains my Java-based solutions to several **Graph problems** from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It serves both as my personal practice and as a reference for others learning common graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Topological Sorting, and more.
